2013-02-13	Automatic malaria diagnosis system	ICRoM	Malaria Diagnosis is normally accomplished by visual microscopy which is time consuming and offers low accuracy because of the operator\'s tiredness and lack of profession in job. To overcome this liability, we designed an automatic system which is able to take photos of blood smears automatically in high rate using motorized sophisticated microscope. After gathering enough samples for microscopy, Image processing task is launched which is the core of our job in this paper. Finally, results of the whole process are reported to physician for prescribing the best cure. Because of the importance of correct diagnosis stage of Malaria and parasite type in curing process, this system can attract a great deal of attention in Malaria Diagnosis task.

If we see these implicit models as dynamical systems, some of these issues are caused by being unable to control their behavior in a meaningful way during the course of training. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded method to guide the training trajectories of GANs by augmenting the GAN loss function with a kernel-based regularization term that controls local and global discrepancies between the model and true distributions. This control signal allows us to inject prior knowledge into the model. We provide theoretical guarantees on the stability of the resulting dynamical system and demonstrate different aspects of it via a wide range of experiments.	"Mehrjou, Arash.

2016-01-01	Improved Bayesian information criterion for mixture model selection	Pattern Recognition Letters	In this paper, we propose a mixture model selection criterion obtained from the Laplace approximation of marginal likelihood. Our approximation to the marginal likelihood is more accurate than Bayesian information criterion (BIC), especially for small sample size. We show experimentally that our criterion works as good as other well-known criteria like BIC and minimum message length (MML) for large sample size and significantly outperforms them when fewer data points are available.

2020-01-15	Counterfactuals uncover the modular structure of deep generative models	ICLR	Deep generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are important tools to capture and investigate the properties of complex empirical data. However, the complexity of their inner elements makes their functioning challenging to assess and modify. In this respect, these architectures behave as black box models. In order to better understand the function of such networks, we analyze their modularity based on the counterfactual manipulation of their internal variables. Experiments with face images support that modularity between groups of channels is achieved to some degree within convolutional layers of vanilla VAE and GAN generators. This helps understand the functional organization of these systems and allows designing meaningful transformations of the generated images without further training.
