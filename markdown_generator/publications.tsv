To overcome this liability, we designed an automatic system which is able to take photos of blood smears automatically in high rate using motorized sophisticated microscope. After gathering enough samples for microscopy, Image processing task is launched which is the core of our job in this paper. Finally, results of the whole process are reported to physician for prescribing the best cure. Because of the importance of correct diagnosis stage of Malaria and parasite type in curing process, this system can attract a great deal of attention in Malaria Diagnosis task.
