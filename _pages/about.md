I do work on basic questions in $S=${$\text{machine learning}, \text{control theory}, \text{genomics}$} and $S \times S$. I guess there exists interesting underlying connections among these fields which I try to show. I also love randomness and below is a photo I stole from Cambridge's Jason Miller [page](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk//~jpm205/)
The content of this website is my <span style="color:red">**Distant Vantage Point**</span> which is not limited to scientific research in above topics, but also thoughts on life, philosophy, whatever makes me a conscious being.
