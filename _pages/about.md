Hi! I'm Arash, a PhD student at Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and ETH ZÃ¼rich. My fields of interests are machine learning and control theory. I consider myself a _method developer_. More than using other methods to do things (which is pretty cool), I am interested in understanding why algorithms work and which details might have been overlooked. Over the last few years, my focus has been on theoretical understanding and developing learning algorithms especially when some sort of dynamics is involved. My interest in dynamics comes from my other background in appied mathematics and control theory. I try to use the strong methematical toolbox of dynamical systems to better understand what is going on in a learing algorithm either when the dynamics is the  the search for a good hypothesis or when dynamics is a natural component of the method as in reinforcement learning.
