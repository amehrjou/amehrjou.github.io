permalink: /publication/2016-01-01-bici
excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose a mixture model selection criterion obtained from the Laplace approximation of marginal likelihood. Our approximation to the marginal likelihood is more accurate than Bayesian information criterion (BIC), especially for small sample size. We show experimentally that our criterion works as good as other well-known criteria like BIC and minimum message length (MML) for large sample size and significantly outperforms them when fewer data points are available.'

In this paper, we propose a mixture model selection criterion obtained from the Laplace approximation of marginal likelihood. Our approximation to the marginal likelihood is more accurate than Bayesian information criterion (BIC), especially for small sample size. We show experimentally that our criterion works as good as other well-known criteria like BIC and minimum message length (MML) for large sample size and significantly outperforms them when fewer data points are available.
