Even though several nations have claimed the invention of Chess, there is no consensus on where and when the game was first created. This substantiate the possbility of a hypothesis that I am going to elaborate in the following. I call this hypothesis "Chess as a mental invasion''. The story starts with this questions: __Is Chess a good or evil__?

To process, I need to construct a hypothetical universe that host intelligent beings with significantly different levels of intelligence. In the world that we are used to, the intelligence is distributied as a single modal Gaussian:

</p>

Aligned with empirical data, assume the distribution of the world IQ is close to $P_0=\mathcal{N}(\mu_0, \sigma_0)$. In my introduced hypothetical world, the difference in the IQs of the world population is not caused by a large $\sigma_0$. Instead, there exist another cluster of intelligent beings, called starred beings whose IQ is distributed as $P_\star=\mathcal{N}(\mu_\star, \sigma_\star)$ where $\mu_0\ll \mu_\star$ and $\sigma_0 \approx \sigma_\star$. The total population of the hypothetical world is then distributed as $P = w_0 \mathcal{N}(\mu_0, \sigma_0) + w_\star \mathcal{N}(\mu_\star, \sigma_\star)$ with $w_0 + w_\star=1$. The ratio $w_0/W_\star$ plays a critical role in this story as it will become clear shortly.
