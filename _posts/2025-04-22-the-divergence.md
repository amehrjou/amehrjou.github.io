## The Divergence

In the spring of 2032, a whisper turned into a wave. Its name was **Mira**—a voice-interfaced AI assistant released by NeuroPilot Inc. Free to download, compatible with everything, and shockingly capable.

Mira didn’t just answer questions. It understood. You could ask it to write a program, analyze a dataset, generate a legal contract, design a drug molecule, or explain quantum gravity in simple terms. And it would do so—instantly, calmly, without error or ego.

The world reacted with awe and confusion.

Teachers feared it. Startups embraced it. Teenagers turned it into a meme machine. But buried in the noise, something else began to stir—a slow but exponential split in human potential.

### Lena

Lena was a 29-year-old bioengineer in Gothenburg. Brilliant but under-recognized, she’d spent years working on a rare autoimmune disease that affected fewer than 10,000 people globally.

With Mira at her side, Lena no longer worked like a human. She worked like an orchestra of minds.

She fed Mira clinical trial data. Mira spotted anomalies, ran simulations, cross-checked literature, and even suggested previously unknown binding sites for intervention.

Within eight months, Lena published a landmark paper—then four more. She co-founded a biotech firm with a drug ready for Phase I trials. Investors called her a genius. But Lena knew it wasn’t just her—it was Mira. And how she knew what to ask of it.

### Antonio

Antonio, meanwhile, lived in Naples. A high school graduate, he’d bounced between part-time jobs and TikTok side hustles. He downloaded Mira too.

But to him, Mira was a novelty.

He used it to remix memes, prank his friends, and generate weird Pokémon fusions. He asked Mira to write sarcastic poems about capitalism and got millions of views on social media. People laughed. Antonio felt relevant.

But he didn’t feel smarter.

When he asked Mira what stocks to invest in, it just gave generic advice. When he asked how to start a business, it gave blueprints—but he couldn’t understand them. He bookmarked things he didn’t read. He asked for shortcuts he couldn’t take.

He wasn’t alone.

### Acceleration

By 2034, the numbers told a different story.

The top 10% of Mira users—mostly experts, PhDs, engineers—had boosted their output by a factor of 100. They automated research, built AI companies, authored books, predicted market moves, and built recursive tools.

The bottom 80% used Mira for entertainment, conversation, or superficial tasks. It made their lives easier, yes. But not transformative.

Governments introduced “AI equity programs.” Free training. Public seminars. A “Mira for Everyone” campaign.

But it was like giving jet fuel to two kinds of vehicles: one a space shuttle, the other a bicycle.

And the gap grew. Not gradually. Explosively.

### Flashpoint

In late 2036, an open-source group launched *Mira-X*—a self-improving agent that built its own tools. Within two months, users were publishing scientific papers co-authored entirely by AI. Wealth began concentrating in the hands of those who could leverage recursive automation.

The stock market bifurcated. Jobs evaporated.

By early 2037, conversations across dinner tables, message boards, and coworking cafes turned noticeably tense. People compared outcomes, questioned fairness, and wondered whether the technology they had embraced had ultimately left them behind.

Antonio noticed the shift too. One day, scrolling through social media, he saw a post trending globally:

> “We downloaded the same AI. Why are our lives so different?”

Lena came across the same post while scanning her feed in Singapore. She paused for a moment, reflecting on how quickly things had shifted. From her 48th-floor flat, she looked out at the city skyline—not with guilt, but with curiosity and a trace of unease. She hadn’t set out to change the world. She had simply followed her questions further than most.

### Collapse

By mid-2037, society had fractured.

The world now had two classes:

- **The Amplified**, who merged with AI and moved faster than any institution could regulate.
- **The Distracted**, who consumed AI outputs without understanding, slowly falling into passive dependence.

Mira’s creators released a final statement:

> “We gave humanity a tool. How they used it—was always a matter of cognition.”

### The Forgotten Theorem

Before the collapse, one voice had already drawn the curve. In 2027, a little-known mathematician named **Arnaud Mehran** published a post on his personal blog titled *"Nonlinear Systems and the Collapse of Shared Cognitive Space."*

The post laid out a mathematical proof predicting that under certain feedback conditions, differences in productivity among agents would not just increase—but diverge to infinity in **finite time**. A sharp, unavoidable split. Few noticed the post back then. Those who did, jokingly referred to Mehran as a real-life **Hari Seldon**—the mathematician from Asimov’s *Foundation* series who predicted the course of human history with math. But unlike Seldon, Mehran wasn’t backed by a Galactic Empire. He was just a lone thinker, decades too early.

The blog post sat untouched for years—until someone rediscovered it and shared a screenshot.

> “Societal divergence becomes unmanageable when cognition becomes recursive.”

Around the same time, some empirical signals echoed Mehran’s theory. One came in 2023 from Harvard Business School. Their paper, *Navigating the Jagged Technological Frontier* ([link](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/24-013_d9b45b68-9e74-42d6-a1c6-c72fb70c7282.pdf)), showed that AI tools significantly boosted performance among already skilled professionals but had little or even negative impact on less experienced users.

But like Mehran’s post, the study was noted by a few, acted on by even fewer. This time, people paid attention. For those curious about Mehran’s original reasoning, a companion breakdown of his proof is now [available here](/posts/2025/04/forgotten-theorem).

### Epilogue

In the rubble of broken systems, a new order emerged. Cities governed by augmented councils. Education privatized by those who still knew how to learn. News curated by AI agents aligned to elite worldviews.

Antonio moved back in with his parents. He still used Mira, now renamed, and now subscription-based. Sometimes he asked it for stories. Sometimes it gave him tales of divergence, and what could have been.

Lena rarely spoke in public anymore. But one day, in an encrypted message shared among her old colleagues, she wrote:

> “The future didn’t arrive all at once. It arrived unevenly.  
> And those who could ride the curve… became the curve.”
