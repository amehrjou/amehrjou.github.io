## The Forgotten Theorem

> *This is a companion to the fictional story ["The Divergence"](/posts/2025/04/divergence), exploring the mathematical idea that inspired it.*

In 2027, a mathematician named **Arnaud Mehran** published a little-known blog post titled *"Nonlinear Systems and the Collapse of Shared Cognitive Space."* The post went unnoticed—until the rise of Mira-X in 2036 made its predictions disturbingly real.

Here is the essence of Mehran's argument.

## Modeling Human Productivity Under AI Amplification

Let:

- $x$ = baseline human capability (e.g., IQ, education, expertise)  
- $P(t)$ = productivity at time $t$  
- $\gamma$ = strength of AI's effect  
- $\alpha$ = how much human capability amplifies AI leverage  
- $\beta > 1$ = nonlinearity or feedback strength (recursive productivity effects)

The productivity evolution is governed by:

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = \gamma \cdot x^\alpha \cdot P^\beta
$$

This describes a **positive feedback loop**: the more capable and productive someone is, the faster their productivity grows.

## Finite-Time Blowup

Solving the differential equation:

$$
\frac{dP}{P^\beta} = \gamma \cdot x^\alpha \cdot dt
$$

Integrating gives:

$$
P(t) = \left[(1 - \beta)(\gamma \cdot x^\alpha \cdot t + C)\right]^{1 / (1 - \beta)}
$$

For $\beta > 1$, this solution **blows up in finite time**. That is:

$$
P(t) \to \infty \text{ as } t \to t^* \text{ for some finite } t^*
$$

Where:

$$
t^* = \frac{P(0)^{1 - \beta}}{\gamma \cdot x^\alpha \cdot (\beta - 1)}
$$

This means: **small differences in capability can lead to exponentially large differences in outcomes in finite time**, not just over decades or centuries.

## Societal Implications

Let $P_i(t)$ be productivity for individual $i$, and define inequality:

$$
\sigma_P(t) = \text{std deviation across } \{P_i(t)\}
$$

Then societal **stability** can be modeled as:

$$
S(t) = \frac{1}{1 + \sigma_P(t)}
$$

If $\sigma_P(t) \to \infty$, then $S(t) \to 0$. Society destabilizes.

Mehran concluded:

> "Societal divergence becomes unmanageable when cognition becomes recursive."

## Postscript

At the time, the proof felt theoretical—just another curve on another blog.

Now, it feels like prophecy.
