<p style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;">What is life?</p> This has been a grand question that humans have asked themselves throughout their existence on earth. People from various perspectives have investigated this question and reached to different conclusions some of which can not be merged into a consistent set of characteristic properties that define a living being.

We humans are the most obvious living system that we know with common sense without actually defining what is the exact definion of the term "living". This human-centeric view may be misleading if it leads to a distant-based definiton of life that actually turns the term living into a continuous adjective where some thing is as much living as it is similar to humans. As soon as we use the word "similar", we have to be careful that it comes with an implcitic metric that judges the similarity of two things. Hence, this self-centeric view does not contribute to understanding the meaning of being alive. We need a more universal observer-independent measure. Can such measure even exists? It is immediately clear that the relevant areas of science are those that do not depend on human constructs and agreed rules. For example, it's unlikely that psychology or sociology could help much as they mostly concern the emergent concepts and norms in individual or collective behaviours. Hence, we need resort to more fundamental areas such as physics and mathematics.

## Schrodinger's apriodic crystal

One of the most known efforts in explaining the boundary between living and non-living things is the lecture series by Erwin Schr√∂dinger in 1944 which was later collected in a book titled "What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell". As expected from the author, the arguments in this lecture originates from physics and chimstry. I call Schrodinger's approach "normative" as what he actually answers is

<p style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;">What it takes for an object to be alive in a universe where the existing phsyical laws hold?</p>
""

I call this approach normative as it serves as a predictor rather than only explaining what is known so far. Note that the structure of genetic material of a cell was not known at the time of Schrodinger's lectures. It's astounishing that his approach laid theoretical description and predcition of how genetic information has to be stored which was later acknowledged by the discoverers of DNA double helix structure in 1953. Before we start looking into his theory, I want to emphasize what Schrodinger wrote in the preface of his book about *noblesse oblige* figuratively refers to the unwritten rule in scientific community that one is expected not to writeon any topic of which he is not a master. In an immensely complex problem such as life, cross-disciplinary knowledge is necessary which made him renounce the *noblesse* and its ensuing obligation with the following excuse:


> We have inherited from our forefathers the keen longing for unified, all-embracing knowledge. The very name given to the highest institutions of learning reminds us, that from antiquity and throughout many centuries the universal aspect has been the only one to be given full credit. But the spread, both in width and depth, of the multifarious branches of knowledge during the last hundred odd years has confronted us with a queer dilemma. We feel clearly that we are only now beginning to acquire reliable material for welding together the sum total of all that is known into a whole; but, on the other hand, it has become next to impossible for a single mind fully to command more than a small specialized portion of it.


This is alarming as it implies that some of the biggest questions are indeed unsolvable. I don't go into more details how this can be proved here not to hurt the cohesion of this article but will hopefully expand it in another article with tentative title


<p style="text-align: center; font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;">On the human-unsolvability of hard questions?</p>

Let's get back to Schrodinger's lectures.
