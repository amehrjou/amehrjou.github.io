# What is life?

This has been a grand question that humans have asked themselves throughout their existence on earth. People from various perspectives have investigated this question and reached to different conclusions some of which can not be merged into a consistent set of characteristic properties that define a living being.

We, humans, are the most obvious living system that we know with common sense without actually defining what is the exact definition of the term "living". This human-centric view may be misleading if it leads to a distant-based definition of life that turns the term living into a continuous adjective where something is as much living as it is similar to humans. As soon as we use the word "similar", we have to be careful that it comes with an implicit metric that judges the similarity of two things. Hence, this self-centric view does not contribute to understanding the meaning of being alive. We need a more universal observer-independent measure. Can such a measure even exist? It is immediately clear that the relevant areas of science are those that do not depend on human constructs and agreed rules. For example, it's unlikely that psychology or sociology could help much as they mostly concern the emergent concepts and norms in individual or collective behaviors. Hence, we need to resort to more fundamental areas such as physics and mathematics.

## Schrodinger's aperiodic crystal

One of the most known efforts in explaining the boundary between living and non-living things is the lecture series by Erwin Schr√∂dinger in 1944 which was later collected in a book titled "What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell". As expected from the author, the arguments in this lecture originate from physics and chemistry. I call Schrodinger's approach "normative" as what he answers is

<p style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;">What it takes for an object to be alive in a universe where the existing phsyical laws hold?</p>
""

I call this approach normative as it serves as a predictor rather than only explaining what is known so far. Note that the structure of the genetic material of a cell was not known at the time of Schrodinger's lectures. It's astonishing that his approach laid theoretical description and prediction of how genetic information has to be stored which was later acknowledged by the discoverers of DNA double helix structure in 1953. Before we start looking into his theory, I want to emphasize what Schrodinger wrote in the preface of his book about *noblesse oblige* figuratively referring to the unwritten rule in the scientific community that one is expected not to write on any topic of which he is not a master. In an immensely complex problem such as life, cross-disciplinary knowledge is necessary which made him renounce the *noblesse* and its ensuing obligation with the following excuse:


> We have inherited from our forefathers the keen longing for unified, all-embracing knowledge. The very name given to the highest institutions of learning reminds us, that from antiquity and throughout many centuries the universal aspect has been the only one to be given full credit. But the spread, both in width and depth, of the multifarious branches of knowledge during the last hundred-odd years has confronted us with a queer dilemma. We feel clearly that we are only now beginning to acquire reliable material for welding together the sum total of all that is known into a whole; but, on the other hand, it has become next to impossible for a single mind fully to command more than a small specialized portion of it.


This is alarming as it implies that some of the biggest questions are indeed unsolvable. I don't go into more details about how this can be proved here not to hurt the cohesion of this article but will hopefully expand it in another article with the tentative title


<p style="text-align: center; font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;">On the human-unsolvability of hard questions?</p>

Let's get back to Schrodinger's lectures.

## The lower-boundedness of the size of living things
One of the first questions that arise when investigating the concept of being alive is the size of living things. Accepting that everything in the physical world is governed by strict physical laws, Schrodinger argues that living things cannot be so small. More precisely, they have to be large enough such that they are not affected by a single or a few atoms. This argument has this implicit assumption for the definition of life that a living thing has an orderly structure and also interacts with orderly things. We know from statistical physics that atoms move almost randomly (heat movement) when observed individually, and physical laws start to appear in the collaboration of an enormously large number of them. Hence, anything consisting of a few atoms will not be able to produce, perceive or interact with orderly things. 

An example of particular interest is the measurement device composed of a light object suspended by a long thin fiber in equilibrium which is used by physicists to measure weak forces that deflect it from its position of equilibrium. Trying to increase the accuracy of measurement by increasing the length of the fiber of making the suspended object lighter meets a limit where the measurement becomes sensitive to the heat motion of the molecules in its surroundings which makes the device useless. Our perception organs are also measurement devices and have to be large enough to measure the statistical behavior of molecules; otherwise, they will be perplexed by the Brownian impact of them which our processing unit (brain) cannot make any sense of. As a rule of thumb, the accuracy of physical laws is within the order of $1/\sqrt{n}$ for $n$ being the number of co-operating particles. This immediately suggests that an organism has to have a gross structure to be able to expect a lawful world. The use of X-ray and measuring the mutation rate gave a lower upper bound for the size of a gene in the order of thousands of atoms.

The mutation is the working ground for evolution. It is indispensable to differentiate between the randomness in the genotype to phenotype process and the mutation in the genotype. The former results in the distribution of the phenotype with connected support while the latter leads to phenotypes values far from the distribution of non-mutated values without observing the intermediate values. Thus, the <p style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;">discontinuoity</p> is the key sign of genetic mutation. It is important that mutation must be a **rare** event otherwise the species may vanish before being evolved.

## The reconciliation of gene sizes and their regular activities
It is historically observed that hereditary attributes are preserved from over centuries. This might look in contrast with the fact the gene which encodes that attribute is small enough to be affected by Brownian heat motion. The key is in the concept of discrete energy and **equilibrium**. Quantum theory predicts discrete levels of energy for atoms. In a more general setting, the molecules which are formed by a few atoms can take only a discrete finite set of **states**. A certain amount of energy has to be given to the molecule to change its state into a higher energy state whose structure is significantly different. This suggests that the gene (and possibly the entire genetic material) is a molecule whose stability is caused by being at the energy equilibrium.

There is a large energy barrier that has to be passed to move from this state to the adjacent lower or higher energy levels; a wall that is too high for the energy of heat motion to be strong enough to climb. I want to draw attention to the probabilistic nature of statements at small-scale physics. One way to facilitate the quantum jump of a molecule from one state to another is by increasing the temperate which lead to more energetic heat motion in its surrounding. The effect is though not deterministic. It increases the chance of the occurrence of such a jump which, due to the ergodicity of the process, can be measured as the time it takes until that jump occurs. That time is a random variable (remember everything is probabilistic!) whose mean is empirically observed to follow an exponential rule:


$$t = \tau^{W/kT}\nonumber$$

which implies the average time it takes to change the ratio of the needed energy to the energy supplied by the surrounding heat bath. Whan a jump occurs, an isomer of the molecule is obtained that is called an *allele* for that location (locus) on the chromosome.
